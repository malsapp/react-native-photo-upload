# react-native-photo-upload

![screenshot](http://g.recordit.co/egzm6lL96l.gif)

This component handles all the hassle in dealing with photos in react native, it's built on top of `react-native-image-picker`, `react-native-image-resizer` and `react-native-fs`
it takes an image component and upon click, you get the image picker prompt, get the base64 string of the image and the image source changes to whatever image was picked.

## Installing

npm or yarn install

```
npm install react-native-photo-upload --save
```
or
```
yarn add react-native-photo-upload
```
## Automatic Installation

link `react-native-image-picker`, `react-native-image-resizer` and `react-native-fs` which the component depends on
```
react-native link react-native-image-picker
react-native link react-native-image-resizer
react-native link react-native-fs
```
#### The following steps are required by `react-native-image-picker` for both Android and IOS even with automatic linking

### Android

* Update the android build tools version to `2.2.+` in `android/build.gradle` (required step by `react-native-image-picker):
```gradle
buildscript {
    ...
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.+' // <- USE 2.2.+ version
    }
    ...
}
...
```

* Update the gradle version to `2.14.1` in `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:
```
 ...
 distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
```

* Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### IOS
For iOS 10+, Add the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (if allowing video) keys to your `Info.plist` with strings describing why your app needs these permissions. **Note: You will get a SIGABRT crash if you don't complete this step**
```
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    ...
    <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
    <string>YOUR_REASON_FOR_USING_USER_PHOTOS_HERE</string>
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>YOUR_REASON_FOR_USING_USER_CAMERA_HERE</string>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

    <Image
      source={{

      if (avatar) {
        console.log('Image base64 string: ', avatar)
      }
